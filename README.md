KBMenu

Add a status bar item with various bookmarks for vnc, afp, ftp, smb bookmarks.

This application runs without an icon in the dock, it adds a new network icon status bar item in your menu bar, you can add bookmarks from that menu and they need to be in the following format:

afp://macname.local vnc://macname.local smb://macname.local etc...


NOTE: This is my first forray into Swift, this project is actually a mix of Swift and Objective-C classes, its definitely not my most elegant work but wanted to start somewhere with a very simple project.
